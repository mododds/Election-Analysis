## Election-Audit Summary
This script can easily be used to quickly summarize hundreds of thousands of votes across various counties or even nationally. With a few quick modifications, this could be accomplished easily. For example:
1) Using an input statement & header to read in any file and populate a clear report title. 
2) The code can be expanded to also show votes per county per candidate in order determine the winners in each county as well as the popular vote.
3) The code could be expanded to also include the runner up for each county within the summary statement.
